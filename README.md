Nancy-UserManager
=================
This is a basic app I built to get to grips with Nancy and forms authentication and also to learn git and github.
It's a work in progress and I need to upload scripts to build the membership DB in SQL server before you can use this example.

It's a VS 2012 project in C# using Nancy, Razor, Bootstrap and a simple SQL server membership DB.

Next step script up the DB so a working version can be built.
